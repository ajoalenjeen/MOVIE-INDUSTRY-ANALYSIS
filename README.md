# MOVIE-INDUSTRY-ANALYSIS

## Project Overview

This project analyzes movies to uncover insights into the movie industry. Using Excel(Data Cleaning), Python (Data Cleaning, EDA, Hypothesis Testing, Regression, Visualization), the goal was to understand patterns in budget, gross revenue, profit, genres, and production companies.

## Key questions explored:

* Do high-budget movies achieve higher ROI than low-budget ones?

* Which genres and months are the most profitable?

* Which companies dominate the industry in terms of profit and gross?

* What are the profit trends of the movie industry since 1980?

* Do runtimes differ significantly across movie genres?

* Does runtime of a movie affect the revenue? 


## Tools & Technologies

* Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy

* Tableau
  
* Excel


## Data Cleaning

* Checked for duplicates

* Populated missing values

* Changed data type

* Added new columns

* Dropped irrelevant records to improve data quality


## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

* Analyzed trends in budget vs gross, profit per month/year, and genre performance

* Identified top-grossing movies and top companies

## Hypothesis Testing

* Null Hypothesis (H₀): High-budget movies do not have higher ROI than low-budget movies

* Result: Failed to reject H₀ → High-budget movies don’t guarantee higher ROI

## Key Insights

* Family & Animation genres deliver the highest average profit

* May, June, July and December are the most profitable release months

* Profitability of the industry has grown consistently since the 1980s

* Top studios like Universal, Warner Bros, and Disney dominate overall profits

* Genres like Drama, Biography, and Mystery generally have longer runtimes (110–130+ minutes), while Animation, Family, and Horror films are shorter (85–100 minutes).

* High budgets ≠ high ROI — profitability depends various aspects like genre & timing

* Runtime appears to have no consistent correlation with a film's gross revenue, as both short and long films achieve varying levels of financial success.
