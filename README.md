# MOVIE-INDUSTRY-ANALYSIS

## Project Overview

This project analyzes movies to uncover insights into the movie industry. Using Excel(Data Cleaning), Python (Data Cleaning, EDA, Hypothesis Testing, Visualization) and Tableau (Dashboard), the goal was to understand patterns in budget, gross revenue, profit, genres, and production companies.

## Key questions explored:

* Do high-budget movies achieve higher ROI than low-budget ones?

* Which genres and months are the most profitable?

* Which companies dominate the industry in terms of profit and gross?


## Tools & Technologies

* Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy

* Tableau
  
* Excel

## Data Cleaning

* Remove year column in excel since some years were wrong

* Checked for duplicates

* Populated missing values

* Changed data type

* Added new columns

* Removed unneseccory rows


## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

* Analyzed trends in budget vs gross, profit per month/year, and genre performance

* Identified top-grossing movies and top companies

Hypothesis Testing

* Null Hypothesis (H₀): High-budget movies do not have higher ROI than low-budget movies

* Result: Failed to reject H₀ → High-budget movies don’t guarantee higher ROI
