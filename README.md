## Key questions explored:

* Evaluate top-performing studios in total box office gross

* What are the profit trends of the movie industry since 1980?

* Which genres and months are the most profitable?

* Do runtimes differ significantly across movie genres?

* Does runtime of a movie affect the revenue?

* Identify relationships between budget and gross revenue

* Do high-budget movies achieve higher ROI than low-budget ones?



## Tech Stack

* Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

* Statistical Tests: Linear regression, correlation, t-test
  
* Excel


## Data Cleaning

* Checked for duplicates

* Populated missing values

* Changed data type

* Added new columns

* Dropped irrelevant records to improve data quality


## Analysis




## Key Insights

* Family & Animation genres deliver the highest average profit

* May, June, July and December are the most profitable release months

* Profitability of the industry has grown consistently since the 1980s

* Top studios like Universal, Warner Bros, and Disney dominate overall profits

* Genres like Drama, Biography, and Mystery generally have longer runtimes (110–130+ minutes), while Animation, Family, and Horror films are shorter (85–100 minutes).

* High budgets ≠ high ROI — profitability depends various aspects like genre & timing

* Runtime appears to have no consistent correlation with a film's gross revenue, as both short and long films achieve varying levels of financial success.
